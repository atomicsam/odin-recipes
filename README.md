This is my first project that I am creating for 'The Odin Project'
It is a website that is about recipes.
This readme will be updated as I learn more about the project itself.
This website allows you to view three different recipes - two basic ones, and one advanced recipe.

--CONCLUSIONS--

After finishing this webiste I have consolidated my knowledge of creating boilerplates, creating both ordered and unordered lists, as well as learning how to use both links (relative and absoulute) and images properly.
